The Interface module must guarantee the following:

1. It will have a button to fetch the token from the Login module.

If the login is successful, it will show a message saying "Login successful." and then shows the token in a text box, with a copy button to copy the token to the clipboard.

2. It will have a button to fetch the option chain from the FetchData module.

While fetching the option chain, it will show a message saying "Fetching option chain..."

If the option chain is fetched successfully, it will show a message saying "Option chain fetched successfully."
