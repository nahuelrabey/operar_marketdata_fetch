The Login module will contain two elements:

1. It will have a function to retrieve the authentication token from the Invertir Online API. It will have two parameters: username and password.

The authentication token will be stored in a file called token.txt in the root folder.

Add a .gitignore file to ignore the token.txt file.

<!-- 2. It will have a user interface to input the username and password. The username and password information will never be stored in the code, nor in any file. 

After a successful login, the user interface will show a message saying "Login successful." and then shows the token in a text box, with a copy button to copy the token to the clipboard. -->
